Welcome to the NetNOW! multi-player library.  To compile the code
simply use the compile.bat batch file and the test code will be built
for you.

The library contains debugging information and will be smaller in the
release version.

NetNOW! automatically detects for the presence of IPX or NetBIOS.  NetBIOS
will take about 5-10 seconds to initialize, IPX will initialize right 
away.

The documentation is still in rough form, but is being updated on a daily
basis and will be posted in the beta area on the BBS.  Please let us know
if any problems are encountered with the beta release and they will be
addressed right away.

The voice chat module will be available early next week.  We are still
resolving some issues concerning multiple sounds cards, etc...
